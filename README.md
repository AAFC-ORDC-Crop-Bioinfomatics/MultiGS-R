# MultiGS-R (v1.0)

## Java Pipeline for Genomic Selection of Multiple Single Traits Using R-Based Models and Diverse Marker Types

**MultiGS-R** is a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly Java-based pipeline for performing genomic selection (GS) analysis. It seamlessly integrates a wide range of popular R packages implementing both classical statistical and modern machine learning models, providing a unified platform for cross-validation and across-population prediction in plant and animal breeding programs.

The pipeline supports multiple genomic marker types (SNPs, haplotypes, and principal components) and a comprehensive suite of GS modeling algorithms, making it an all-in-one solution for breeders and researchers.

## Introduction

Genomic Selection accelerates genetic improvement by predicting the genetic-estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of individuals based on their genomic markers. MultiGS-R automates the complex workflow of GS, which includes data preprocessing, quality control, imputation, model training, and validation. By leveraging the robust statistical capabilities of R within a managed Java pipeline, MultiGS-R ensures reproducibility, scalability, and ease of use for both small-scale studies and large breeding populations.

## Key Features

-   **Flexible Analysis Modes:** Supports both **cross-validation** (for
    model evaluation) and independent **across-population prediction**
     (using a training set to predict a test set).

-   **Multiple Marker Views:**

    -   **SNP:** Direct use of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).

    -   **HAP:** Conversion of SNPs into haplotype blocks using RTM-GWAS
         SNP-LD for potentially capturing epistatic effects.

    -   **PC:** Use of Principal Components as markers to reduce
         dimensionality and address multicollinearity.

-   **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:** Includes sample alignment, genotype harmonization between training and test lines, and missing data imputation.

-   **Diverse GS Modeling Methods:** Integrates several state-of-the-art
     models via R packages:
    
    -  **Linear Models:** Ridge-Regression BLUP (RR-BLUP) via rrBLUP and Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictio (GBLUP) via BGLR.

    -  **Kernel Methods:** Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS).

    -  **System RBayesian Approaches:** BL (Bayesian LASSO), BRR (Bayesian Ridge Regression), BayesA, BayesB, BayesC via BGLR.

    -  **Machine Learning:** Random Forest for Regression (RFR) and Classification (RFC), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Classification (SVC).

## Input Files

### Genotypic Data (Markers)

-   **Format:** standard VCF (Variant Call Format) with header - can be compressed (.vcf.gz) or uncompressed
-   **Requirements:**
    -   For **Cross-Validation:** One VCF file for the training population
    -   For **Prediction:** Two VCF files (training and test)

### Phenotypic Data

-   **Format:** Tab-delimited text file **with a header row**
-   **Structure:**
    -   First column: Individual/Sample IDs
    -   Subsequent columns: Phenotypic values for different traits

**Example** training_pheno.txt

```text

SampleID Yield Height Weight
sample_1 5.6 112 45
sample_2 4.8 105 42
sample_3 NA 108 44
```
*Missing values should be coded as NA. The pipeline will handle them
automatically.*

## Usage

1.  **Prepare your configuration file** following the template above

2.  **Run the pipeline:**

   ``` bash
java -jar MultiGS-R_1.0.jar /path/to/your/config.ini
```

3.  **Monitor progress:**
The pipeline will display progress in the console and write detailed logs to the output directory

**For large datasets, you may need to increase memory allocation:**

```bash

java -Xmx8g -jar MiltiGS-R_1.0.jar config.ini
```

## Output

The pipeline generates a well-organized directory structure:

```bash
result_folder/
├── gs\_\<timestamp\>.log \# Detailed log file
├── all_CV_results.txt \# Detailed CV results (CV mode)
├── CV_summary_statistics.csv \# Summary statistics (CV mode)
├── prediction_detailed_results.txt \# Model results (Prediction mode)
│
├── trait_predictions/ \# Predicted values for test set
│ └── \<Trait\>\_\<Model\>\_prediction_data.txt
├── plots/ \# Diagnostic plots
│ ├── MDS_plot.png \# Population structure
│ └── \... \# Other visualizations
├── intermediate_data/ \# Processed intermediate files
└── pheno_data/ \# Preprocessed phenotypic data
```
## Troubleshooting

-   **\"RScript not found\":**
  Verify the RScriptPath in your configuration file is correct

-   **Missing R packages:**
  Check the log file for package errors and install missing packages in R

-   **Memory errors:**
  Use -Xmx parameter to increase Java heap space  e.g., -Xmx8g for 8GB)

-   **VCF file errors:**
  Ensure your VCF files are properly formatted and have necessary header
